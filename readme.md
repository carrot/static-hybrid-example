# carrots-example

This is an example roots project that uses an API to render its contents, half static and half dynamic. Some of the contents are compiled directly into the static files, and some of the contents are loaded in dynamically using javascript on user interaction. Both use the same template.

### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`
